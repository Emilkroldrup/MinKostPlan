# Entity Directory

This directory houses the entity classes of the application. Entities are domain models that represent database tables logically.

## Responsibilities
- Define the structure of various data objects with annotations to configure ORM behavior.
- Represent relationships between data tables.
- Serve as data transfer objects between the database and service layers.

## Usage
Entities are used throughout the application to represent and manipulate data as objects. They are crucial for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) operations.
